h1. nano-mapreduce

A Clojure library for executing map-reduce jobs. As its name implies, it is not design to run on a cluster. Instead it works on a single JVM (machine). Mostly done for (self) educational purposes. There are some accompanying examples showcasing its usage.

h2. Usage

The examples can be found in the examples folder. They use the input data from the ./data/in folder.

Add this namespace declaration:
bc. (:require [nano-mapreduce.core :as mr])

Run this way:
bc. (mr/exec "path/to/your/json/file" map-function reduce-function)

Actually the format of the file is pseudo json. Each line is a json entry.
Your map and reduce function should return a list of lists (in order to accomodate both jobs that return a result and jobs that return a list of results).
